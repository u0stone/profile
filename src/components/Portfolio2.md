#Node.js - Simple structure website

- ## You can use id: &apos;a@b.c&apos;, password: &apos;aaa&apos; for log-in instead of using &apos;Join-Us&apos;.
- ## Originaly made for the course project, December, 2019.
I added some features later for the portfolio. 
- Switched session authentication to JWT.
- Switched local DB to Mongo Atlas Cloud Service
- Local hosting to AWS.

- ## What I am using
- Node.js + Express: General use of backend jobs.
- JWT authentication.
- Hosting with Linux Virtual Machine in AWS.
- MongoDB Atlas Cloud + Mongoose.
- BootStrap: General use of setup lay out and designs.
- JQuery + JQuery Plugin: Simplify Ajax Jobs, Slide-show.
